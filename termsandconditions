If you abuse the platform or violate these terms, we may suspend or terminate your account.
User Content & Data: If you upload or input any content or data (for example, proposal documents, personal information, etc.), you retain ownership of that content. However, you give The RFP Queen, LLC a license to use, copy, and process your content solely as needed to provide the service to you. We will handle your data in accordance with our Privacy Policy (see Section 2 below) and will not use your personal data for other purposes without consent.

Privacy: We care about your privacy. By using our service, you also agree to our data practices described in the Privacy Policy (Section 2). In short, we collect the information needed to operate the service and improve it, and we protect that information. We do not sell your personal data. For details on global data storage, use of AI, and your rights, please review the Privacy Policy[1][2].

If your account is terminated, you will lose access to the service and any data or content you stored on the platform (so you should keep backups of your own data).
Governing Law & Disputes: These terms are governed by the laws of the State of Ohio (USA), without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes will be attempted to be resolved amicably; if not, they will be brought in the state or federal courts of Ohio, and you consent to the jurisdiction of those courts.

2. Full Privacy Policy (Global Data Storage, AI Integration, General Business Data)
Effective Date: November 25, 2025
Last Updated: November 25, 2025
Introduction. The RFP Queen, LLC (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect about you, how we use and share it, and your rights regarding that information. It applies to data collected through our websites, applications, and services (collectively, the “Services”). By using our Services, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Services.
Who We Are: The RFP Queen, LLC is a company based in Ohio, USA (7088 Fonso Drive, New Albany, Ohio 43054). We are the “data controller” for personal information we handle in providing the Services (except for certain enterprise scenarios described in the GDPR/CCPA Addendum where we act as a processor on behalf of enterprise clients). You can contact us at therfpqueen@gmail.com with any privacy-related questions or requests.
Information We Collect: We collect several types of information (“Personal Data” or simply “information”) about users of our Services:
Information You Provide Directly: When you sign up or interact with our Services, you may give us information such as your name, email address, company name, job title, billing information, and any content you submit or upload. For example, if you create an account, we will collect your contact details and a password; if you enter information into our platform (such as RFP documents, project details, or messages), we will collect whatever data you choose to provide.
Business Data: If you use our Services on behalf of a business or in a professional capacity, we may collect business-related information such as your company’s details, your role or department, and any data related to proposals or sales enablement content you manage through our platform. This “general business data” may include documents, templates, or client information that you input into the Service. We treat such data as confidential and use it only to provide the Services to you (see “How We Use Information” below).
Automated Information (Cookies and Usage Data): Like many online services, we automatically collect certain data when you use our Services. This includes technical information (IP address, device type, browser type, operating system, unique device identifiers) and usage information (pages or features you access, time and date of access, actions taken within the app, and error logs). We may use cookies or similar tracking technologies to collect some of this data. This information helps us understand how users interact with our Services, enables us to secure the platform, and improve user experience. It does not directly identify you by name, but it might be linked to your account.
Third-Party Sources: We may receive information about you from third-party sources. For example, if you log in via a single sign-on provider (like Google or LinkedIn), we receive basic profile info from them with your consent. If an enterprise client provides us a list of authorized users or other data required for using the service, we collect that from the client. We may also collect public business contact information (such as via LinkedIn or company websites) for outreach or user verification, in compliance with applicable laws.
Sensitive Data: We do not actively seek to collect sensitive personal data (such as health information, social security numbers, or information about racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, etc.) through our Services. We ask that you do not upload or submit sensitive personal information to our platform. If you choose to include any sensitive data, you consent to our processing of that data as needed for the Service. We will only process sensitive data with extra care and in line with legal requirements.
Children’s Privacy: Our Services are not intended for individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are under 16, do not use or provide any information on the Services. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under 16 without parental consent, we will delete that information. Parents or guardians who believe we might have information about a child can contact us to request deletion.
How We Use Information: We use the collected information for the following purposes:
To Provide and Maintain the Service: We process your personal data to create your account, authenticate you when you log in, operate the platform’s functionality (for example, to store your RFP documents or track your progress in a training module), and deliver services you request. This includes using information to personalize your experience (such as remembering your preferences or suggesting relevant content).
To Improve and Develop Our Services: We analyze usage data and feedback to understand how our Services are used and to make improvements. Personal data may be used in aggregated or anonymized form to help us spot trends, fix issues, and develop new features or offerings[5]. For example, we might look at how often certain features are used or analyze anonymized content to improve our AI algorithms. If we use AI or machine learning (see “AI Integration” below), we might use some data inputs to train or fine-tune our models, but we will not use personally identifiable information for AI training in a way that could identify you, unless we have your permission.
AI Integration: Our Services may include features powered by artificial intelligence or machine learning. For instance, we might offer an AI-based tool to suggest proposal language or analyze RFP requirements. When you use these features, the relevant data (e.g. text you input for analysis) may be processed by our AI algorithms or sent to a trusted AI service provider to generate results. We use AI tools in a privacy-conscious manner: wherever feasible, we strip out personal identifiers and use only the content needed for the AI task[6][7]. The AI output is provided back to you and not used for any unrelated purposes. We do not use your personal data to train broad, public AI models without your consent (any machine learning training we do is either on anonymized data or to improve models that operate solely within our Service for your benefit).
Communications: We use contact information (like your email) to send you service-related communications. These include confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support messages. We may also send newsletters, marketing emails or special offers if you have opted in. You can opt out of marketing communications at any time by clicking “unsubscribe” in those emails or contacting us. (We will still send essential notices about your account or transactions as needed.)
Customer Support: If you reach out with questions, feedback, or support requests, we will use your provided information (like contact info and the content of your inquiry) to respond and resolve any issues.
Legal Compliance and Protection: We may process your information as required to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal obligations (for example, keeping transaction records for accounting/tax purposes, or responding to lawful requests by government authorities). We also may use or disclose information to enforce our Terms & Conditions, to investigate or prevent suspected fraud or security issues, and to protect the rights, property, and safety of The RFP Queen, our users, or the public. This can include cooperating with law enforcement if appropriate.
Business Transfers: If we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that deal. We would ensure the new owner continues to honor the commitments we’ve made in this Privacy Policy.
We will only use your personal data for the purposes above and will not sell your personal information to third parties. If we plan to use your data for any purpose that is incompatible with the original purpose of collection, we will inform you and, if required, obtain your consent.
How We Share Information: We may share your information with the following categories of recipients, only to the extent necessary for the purposes described:
Service Providers: We use trusted third-party companies to help us operate and support the Services. Examples include cloud hosting providers (for data storage), email service providers (for sending communications), payment processors (for handling billing transactions), analytics providers, or customer support software. These service providers process data on our behalf and are contractually obligated to safeguard your information and use it only for providing services to us. If our AI integration relies on a third-party AI API, that provider will receive the data you submit for AI processing; we ensure such providers are under confidentiality and data security obligations similar to ours.
Enterprise Customers: If you access our Services through an enterprise subscription (for example, your employer or another organization is our customer and provides you access), the account owner (enterprise customer) may have access to your user account information and content. For instance, your employer might see usage reports or content you create under their organization’s account. Such data sharing is controlled by the enterprise (they must handle your data in line with their own policies and applicable law). We only provide it to them as needed to provide the service.
Affiliates: We may share data with our corporate affiliates (e.g., if we have subsidiaries or related companies) for purposes consistent with this Policy, such as internal administration or to support services on our behalf. All such entities are bound to protect your information to the same standard.
Legal and Safety Reasons: We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, court order, or government request; (ii) enforce our Terms & Conditions or other agreements; or (iii) protect the rights, property, or safety of The RFP Queen, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with law enforcement or other companies for fraud prevention or security threat reduction.
Business Transfers: As noted above, if The RFP Queen, LLC is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, restructuring, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred to a successor or affiliate as part of that transaction. In such cases, we will seek to ensure the new entity follows this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal data.
With Your Consent: We will share your personal data with others if you explicitly direct us to or consent to such sharing. For example, if you integrate our Service with a third-party tool (like a CRM or Slack integration) and approve the data exchange, we will send data to that third party as authorized by you.
Importantly, we do not sell personal information to third parties for their own marketing or advertising. We also do not share personal data with third-party advertisers or ad networks. Any third-party analytics or tracking tools on our Services are configured to limit data usage (for example, using anonymized or aggregated data whenever possible).
Global Data Storage & Transfers: The RFP Queen, LLC operates primarily from the United States, but we utilize cloud infrastructure that may be global in nature. We operate as a global business and have global data storage and processing arrangements[1]. This means the information we collect from you may be transferred to and stored in servers located in countries outside of your own (including the United States and possibly other jurisdictions)[1]. It may also be processed by our team members or service providers in different countries. Regardless of where your data is processed, we take steps to protect it in line with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.
If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that we might transfer personal data to countries which may not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. In such cases, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place: for example, we may rely on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses or other lawful transfer mechanisms to ensure your data remains protected[8]. By providing your information to us, you consent to the transfer of your data to the U.S. and other jurisdictions as explained here, with the understanding that we will protect it as described in this policy. We also commit that any international data transfers will comply with applicable privacy laws, such as GDPR requirements for equivalent privacy protection[9].
Data Security: We employ a range of security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include technical, administrative, and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the data. For example, we use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data in transit, encryption or other protections for sensitive data at rest, firewalls and intrusion detection systems to guard our network, and access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can access personal data. We also regularly update and patch our software and train our staff on data security practices. However, please understand that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We strive to protect your personal data, but we cannot guarantee absolute security of information sent to our Services[10]. You share and use our Services at your own risk, and it is important that you also take steps to secure your accounts (such as choosing a strong password and keeping it confidential). If we become aware of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will notify you and the appropriate authorities as required by law.
Data Retention: We keep your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. For example, account information is retained as long as your account is active; if you delete your account or it becomes inactive, we will delete or anonymize your personal data within a reasonable period after account closure, except where we need to keep it for legal obligations or legitimate business purposes. We may retain certain transaction records or communications as required by law (e.g., financial records for tax purposes kept for X years). We also periodically review the data we have and delete or anonymize that which we no longer need. In summary, we do not retain personal information longer than necessary for the stated purposes or as required by law[11]. If deletion is not immediately feasible (for example, because the data is stored in backups), we will securely store and isolate it from further use until deletion is possible.
Your Rights and Choices: You have certain rights regarding your personal data, which may vary depending on your jurisdiction. We are committed to honoring applicable data rights and providing you with control over your information:
Access and Correction: You have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to ask for corrections of any inaccuracies. You can access and update some of your profile and account information by logging into your account settings. For any additional access or correction requests, contact us at therfpqueen@gmail.com. We will respond as required by law, and in any case, usually within 30 days.
Deletion (Right to be Forgotten): You may request that we delete your personal data. For example, if you no longer want us to have your information, you can ask that we erase it. Note that we may need to retain certain data if required for legal obligations or legitimate interests (we will inform you if so). Also, if you delete your account, most of your data will be removed, but some residual backups or aggregated data may persist for a short time.
Objection and Restriction: You have the right to object to or ask us to restrict processing of your data in certain circumstances. For instance, you can ask us to stop using your data for direct marketing (and we will always honor that). If you believe we are processing your data unlawfully or beyond the purpose, you can request restriction.
Data Portability: To the extent required by applicable law (e.g., GDPR), you may have the right to receive the personal data you provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to have us transmit that data to another service provider where technically feasible. This typically applies to data processed by automated means and based on your consent or a contract.
California Privacy Rights: If you are a California resident, you have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (as amended by CPRA) – including the right to know what personal information we collect, the right to request deletion of your personal information, the right to opt-out of the “sale” or “sharing” of personal information (however, note that we do not sell personal data), and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising your privacy rights. Please see the GDPR/CCPA Compliance Addendum (Section 4) for more details on rights and how to exercise them[12][13].
Withdrawing Consent: In cases where we rely on your consent to process personal data (for example, if you consented to optional marketing emails or certain data uses), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. For example, you can unsubscribe from marketing emails by clicking the link in the email or contacting us.
Managing Cookies/Tracking: You can control or delete cookies and other trackers through your browser settings or opt-out mechanisms (like the “Do Not Track” setting or specific opt-out links for analytics). Our Cookie Policy (if separate) or this section provides information on how to adjust your preferences. Essential cookies for site functionality cannot be disabled without affecting service performance.
To exercise any of your rights, please contact us at therfpqueen@gmail.com with your request. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests (to ensure that we do not provide your data to someone else). We will respond to your request within the timeframe required by law (generally within 30 days for GDPR, and 45 days for CCPA requests, with extensions if necessary which we will communicate to you). If we cannot fulfill your request in whole or in part, we will explain the reason (e.g., if it conflicts with a legal obligation or we cannot verify your identity).
If you are in the EU/EEA, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority if you believe we have not addressed your concerns satisfactorily. (For example, in the UK it’s the Information Commissioner’s Office, in France the CNIL, etc.) We encourage you to contact us first, so we can try to resolve your issue.
Do Not Track Signals: Our website does not currently respond to “Do Not Track” browser signals. At this time, no uniform standard for DNT has been adopted. We treat all user requests and signals consistently with the privacy rights described above, and you may use the opt-out options we provide for cookies and analytics.
Changes to This Privacy Policy: We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as our services and legal requirements evolve. If we make material changes, we will notify users by posting the updated policy on our website and updating the “Last Updated” date above. In some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as by email or a pop-up notification) for significant changes. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically for any updates. Your continued use of the Services after an update signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the changes, you should stop using the Services and, if applicable, delete your account.
Contact Us: If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or your personal data, you can contact our privacy team at:

3. Enterprise Terms & Conditions
Effective Date: November 25, 2025
These Enterprise Terms & Conditions (the “Agreement”) govern the access to and use of The RFP Queen, LLC’s services by enterprise customers. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity (“Customer”), you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity. In that case, “you” or “Customer” refers to the entity. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use or access the Enterprise Services.
Parties. This Agreement is between The RFP Queen, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company with its principal office at 7088 Fonso Drive, New Albany, Ohio 43054 (“Provider”, “we” or “us”), and the Customer identified in an ordering document or online registration for an Enterprise Subscription (“Customer” or “you”). Provider and Customer are each a “Party” and collectively the “Parties.” This Agreement becomes effective and binding when Customer signs an order form or electronically accepts these terms (the “Effective Date”).
Services. Provider agrees to provide Customer with access to The RFP Queen’s enterprise platform and related services (“Services”) as set forth in one or more ordering documents, statements of work, or online signup pages (collectively, an “Order Form”). The specific Services, subscription term, fees, and any special conditions will be detailed in the Order Form. This Agreement, together with any Order Form and any incorporated attachments (like the GDPR/CCPA Addendum in Section 4), constitute the complete Master Agreement between Customer and Provider for the Enterprise Services. In the event of a conflict, the Order Form and Addendums take precedence over these general terms to the extent of the conflict.
3.1 License Grant and Scope of Use
3.1.1 Access Rights: Subject to Customer’s compliance with this Agreement (including payment of fees), Provider grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the Services during the subscription term for Customer’s internal business purposes. This license allows use of the Services by the number of authorized users/seats specified in the Order Form (each an “Authorized User”). Authorized Users must be Customer’s employees or contractors acting on Customer’s behalf. Customer is responsible for ensuring that all Authorized Users comply with these terms.
3.1.2 Account Setup: Provider will either provide account credentials or enable Customer to create accounts for Authorized Users. Customer shall ensure that account information is kept secure and that each login is used only by the one person to whom it is assigned. Account Responsibility: Customer is responsible for all activity that occurs under its Authorized User accounts. If Customer becomes aware of any unauthorized access or use of the accounts or Service, it shall promptly notify Provider and cooperate to remediate the issue.
3.1.3 Usage Restrictions: Customer shall use the Services only in accordance with the agreed scope and any usage limits in the Order Form. Except as expressly allowed by this Agreement, Customer shall not (and shall not permit any third party to): (a) sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, distribute or timeshare the Services to any third party; (b) attempt to copy, modify, duplicate, create derivative works of, frame, mirror, republish, download or scrape any portion of the Services or content (except Customer’s own content); (c) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the Services or software (except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by law); (d) use the Services to store or transmit any virus, malware or harmful code, or to engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the integrity or performance of the Services; or (e) use the Services to develop or offer a competing product or service. Customer is also responsible for use of the Services by anyone who gains access through Customer’s credentials or systems (other than through Provider’s fault).
3.2 Customer Data and Intellectual Property
3.2.1 Customer Data Ownership: “Customer Data” means any data, information, or material that Customer or its Authorized Users upload or submit to the Services (including but not limited to text, documents, files, or personal information). Customer retains all rights and ownership in the Customer Data. Provider does not claim ownership of Customer Data.
3.2.2 License to Provider: Customer hereby grants Provider a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, store, transmit, and display Customer Data solely as necessary to provide the Services under this Agreement[14]. For example, we will host and back up the data you upload, and may transmit it to Authorized Users or process it to generate results as per the Service’s functionality. Provider may also sub-license these rights to its subcontractors (such as cloud hosting providers) solely for purposes of providing the Services[14]. We will not use Customer Data for any other purpose except as permitted by this Agreement or as instructed by Customer.
3.2.3 Anonymized Analytics: Provider is permitted to collect and use data relating to Customer’s use of the Services in an aggregated and anonymized manner for legitimate business purposes, such as improving the Services, developing new features, or compiling statistical insights[5]. Any such data will be stripped of personal identifiers and will not identify Customer or any individual. For example, we might track overall platform usage trends or average proposal completion times across our user base. These analytics will not include any confidential Customer specifics.
3.2.4 AI and Machine Learning Features: If the Services include AI-assisted features (e.g., content suggestions or analysis tools), Provider may process Customer Data through these algorithms as part of providing the functionality. Provider will ensure that any AI processing of Customer Data is done in accordance with the Privacy Policy and the GDPR/CCPA Addendum. By using an AI feature, Customer acknowledges that Provider (or its AI subcontractor) will analyze the relevant data input to generate the output, and consents to such processing. Provider warrants that any AI features do not use personal identifiers beyond what is necessary and rely on anonymized or aggregated data where possible[6]. Provider will not use Customer Data from AI processing to improve its general models unless it falls under anonymized analytics as described above or unless Customer provides permission.
3.2.5 Provider Intellectual Property: Except for Customer Data, all rights, title, and interest in the Services and associated content, including but not limited to software, code, algorithms, templates, training materials, text, graphics, logos, and trademarks (“Provider IP”), are and will remain the sole property of Provider or its licensors[15]. The Agreement does not grant Customer any ownership in or license to Provider IP except for the limited use rights in Section 3.1. Customer shall not remove or obscure any copyright, trademark, or proprietary notices on the Provider IP. If Customer provides any feedback or suggestions to Provider about the Services, Provider may use such feedback without obligation.
3.3 Fees, Payment and Taxes
3.3.1 Fees: Customer shall pay all fees specified in the Order Form or pricing plan for the Services. Fees may include subscription fees (e.g. annual or monthly platform fees), usage-based fees, or one-time service fees. All fees are stated and payable in U.S. Dollars (unless otherwise noted).
3.3.2 Invoicing and Payment: Fees will be invoiced or charged in advance on the schedule stated in the Order Form (for example, annually in advance, or monthly). If the Order Form doesn’t specify, subscription fees are billed annually in advance. Payment is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date unless otherwise agreed. If Customer provided a credit card or other payment method, Customer authorizes Provider to charge such payment method for the Services.
3.3.3 Late Payments: If any undisputed fee is not paid by the due date, Provider may (a) charge interest on the past due amount at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate allowed by law, if lower) from the due date until paid; and/or (b) suspend the Services upon ten (10) days’ written notice to Customer, until payment is made. Provider will give Customer at least one reminder of overdue payment before suspension.
3.3.4 Taxes: Fees are exclusive of any taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Customer is responsible for all applicable sales, use, VAT, or similar taxes on the Services (excluding taxes on Provider’s income). If Provider has the legal obligation to pay or collect taxes for which Customer is responsible, Provider will add such taxes to Customer’s invoice and Customer shall pay them, unless Customer provides a valid tax exemption certificate.
3.3.5 Fee Adjustments: For any renewal term, Provider may adjust the subscription fees by providing at least 60 days’ notice prior to the renewal. If Customer does not agree to the adjusted fees, Customer may elect not to renew (terminate) per Section 3.7.1; continuing to use the Service into the renewal term will constitute acceptance of the new fees.
3.4 Customer Obligations and Warranties
3.4.1 Compliance with Laws: Customer represents and warrants that it will use the Services in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including export control laws and data privacy laws. Customer is responsible for obtaining any consents from individuals whose personal data may be uploaded to the Service by Customer. For example, if Customer uploads personal data of third parties, Customer must have the right to do so. Provider will process that data as per the GDPR/CCPA Addendum (Section 4).
3.4.2 Acceptable Use Policy: Customer shall not use the Services to post, upload, transmit or otherwise disseminate any content that: (a) is unlawful, harmful, hateful, obscene, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable; (b) infringes any third-party intellectual property or privacy rights; or (c) contains any viruses or harmful code. Customer warrants that it either owns or has obtained the necessary licenses for all Customer Data it uploads, and that our use of such data as contemplated by this Agreement will not violate any laws or rights of others[16][17]. Provider reserves the right to remove or disable access to any content that violates these terms or law, and will notify Customer if such action is taken (unless prohibited by law).
3.4.3 Confidentiality: Each Party may disclose certain non-public, proprietary information to the other party under this Agreement (“Confidential Information”). Customer’s Confidential Information includes Customer Data and business plans or technical info disclosed to Provider; Provider’s Confidential Information includes the Services (including non-public features and documentation) and pricing information, as well as any other information a reasonable person would understand to be confidential given the nature of the information and circumstances of disclosure. Each Party agrees to use the other’s Confidential Information only for purposes of fulfilling this Agreement, and not disclose it to any third party except to its employees or contractors who need to know it and are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective[18][19]. Each Party will protect the other’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own similar confidential info, but no less than reasonable care. Confidential Information does not include information that is or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement, was known to the recipient prior to disclosure, is received from a third party without confidentiality obligation, or was independently developed without use of the other’s info. If required by law or court order to disclose Confidential Information, a Party may do so, provided it (if legally permitted) gives the other Party prompt notice to seek a protective order. The obligations in this section survive termination of the Agreement for a period of five (5) years (and indefinitely for any trade secrets).
3.4.4 Indemnification by Customer: Customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Provider and its affiliates, officers, and employees from any third-party claims, demands, lawsuits or proceedings, and all related liabilities, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), that arise out of or relate to: (a) Customer’s or Authorized Users’ misuse of the Services in violation of this Agreement; (b) Customer Data or content provided by Customer (for example, claims that Customer Data infringes someone’s intellectual property or privacy rights); or (c) Customer’s violation of any law or regulation in its use of the Services. Provider will: notify Customer of any such claim promptly; give Customer sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim (provided the settlement fully releases Provider of liability and does not impose obligations on Provider); and provide reasonable cooperation at Customer’s expense. This indemnity will not apply to the extent the claim arises from Provider’s breach of this Agreement or willful misconduct.
3.5 Warranties and Disclaimers
3.5.1 Provider Warranties: Provider warrants that: (i) it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement; and (ii) it will provide the Services in a manner consistent with general industry standards reasonably applicable to the provision of similar services. Limited Remedy: If the Services materially deviate from the above warranty, Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the issue. If Provider cannot substantially correct the issue in a reasonable timeframe (not to exceed 30 days from notice), Customer may terminate the affected Services and receive a prorated refund of prepaid fees for the unused portion of the subscription as of termination. This remedy is Customer’s exclusive remedy for breach of the warranty in this Section.
3.5.2 Customer Warranties: Customer warrants that it has the right and authority to enter into this Agreement and that it will abide by all obligations herein, including payment of fees and compliance with laws. Customer also warrants that in using the Services it will not cause Provider to violate any applicable laws.
3.5.3 Disclaimer of Warranties: Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Services are provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Provider and its suppliers disclaim all other warranties, express or implied, including any implied warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose[20]. Provider does not warrant that the Services will be completely error-free, uninterrupted, secure, or that all defects will be corrected. Customer acknowledges that no platform or software is perfect, and internet services may experience occasional outages or performance issues. Provider is not responsible for issues outside its control, such as internet downtime or third-party services. Customer has independently evaluated the Services and is not relying on any statement not set out in this Agreement.
3.6 Limitation of Liability
3.6.1 Indirect Damages: To the fullest extent permitted by law, neither party will be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, data, or business opportunity[3]. This exclusion applies even if a party was advised of the possibility of such damages and even if direct damages do not fully compensate for any loss. For example, Provider is not liable for loss of Customer’s revenue or reputational harm resulting from a service interruption or data loss.
3.6.2 Liability Cap: Provider’s total cumulative liability arising out of or related to this Agreement will not exceed the amount of fees Customer paid to Provider in the six (6) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim[4]. If no fees were paid (for example, during a free trial), Provider’s liability is limited to \$100 USD. The existence of multiple claims or events will not enlarge this cap. This limitation applies to all causes of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, and regardless of the theory of liability.
3.6.3 Exceptions: The above limitations of liability (in 3.6.1 and 3.6.2) shall not apply to: (a) breaches of confidentiality (Section 3.4.3) or violations of intellectual property rights by Customer (e.g., Customer’s misuse of Provider’s IP); (b) Customer’s indemnification obligations; or (c) liability for death or personal injury caused by a party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, or any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited by law. In such cases, liability will be limited to the smallest extent possible under law.
3.6.4 Acknowledgment: The Parties acknowledge that the fees reflect the allocation of risk set forth in this Agreement and that each Party would not have entered into the Agreement without these liability limitations. These limitations are an essential basis of the bargain between the Parties.
3.7 Term and Termination
3.7.1 Term: The term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and continue for the subscription period specified in the Order Form (the “Initial Term”). Unless otherwise stated, subscriptions will automatically renew for successive renewal terms equal in duration to the Initial Term (e.g., another year for an annual plan) unless either Party gives written notice of non-renewal at least 30 days before the current term ends. Pricing for renewals will be as provided in the renewal invoice or notice (subject to fee adjustments per Section 3.3.5).
3.7.2 Termination for Cause: Either Party may terminate this Agreement (including any or all Order Forms) for cause: (a) if the other Party materially breaches any provision of the Agreement and fails to cure the breach within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice describing the breach; or (b) immediately if the other Party becomes insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, files for bankruptcy or similar protection (or has an involuntary petition filed against it that isn’t dismissed within 60 days), or ceases business operations. Provider may also terminate immediately if Customer breaches Section 3.1.3 (Unauthorized Use) or Section 3.4 (Compliance and AUP), as such breaches could jeopardize the security or legality of the Services (Provider will notify Customer of such termination).
3.7.3 Termination for Convenience: Customer may choose to terminate the Agreement or any Service for convenience at any time by providing written notice to Provider. However, unless otherwise stated in an Order Form or required by law, no refunds will be provided for early termination; Customer will remain responsible for fees for the full subscription term. (For example, if Customer prepaid an annual subscription and terminates halfway, the prepaid amount will not be refunded, except at Provider’s discretion or if required by law.) Provider may also terminate a free trial or free tier account for convenience with notice (or immediately if the trial period ends).
3.7.4 Effect of Termination: Upon expiration or termination of the Agreement for any reason: (a) Customer’s access to the Services will be disabled, and Customer shall immediately stop using the Services; (b) Customer will pay any outstanding amounts owed for Services up to the termination date; and (c) Data Return/Deletion: Within 30 days of termination, upon Customer’s request, Provider will allow Customer to export or download Customer Data still in the Service. After that period, Provider will delete or anonymize Customer Data in its systems, except as required to retain by law or as archived in backups (which will remain protected). Provider is not obligated to retain Customer Data after this 30-day post-termination period, so Customer should export data it needs before that time. If requested, Provider can certify in writing that Customer Data has been deleted from active systems.
3.7.5 Surviving Provisions: Any provision of this Agreement that by its nature should survive termination (such as confidentiality, indemnities, limitations of liability, accrued rights to payment, and any provisions expressly stated to survive) will remain in effect. Termination does not relieve either party from liability for breaches occurring prior to termination.
3.8 Miscellaneous
3.8.1 Entire Agreement: This Agreement (including all Order Forms and addenda like the Privacy Policy and GDPR/CCPA Addendum incorporated by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between Customer and Provider regarding the Enterprise Services, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter[21]. Each Party acknowledges that in entering this Agreement it has not relied on any statement or promise not expressly set out herein. Any terms in a Customer purchase order or other document that are inconsistent with this Agreement are rejected and will be void unless signed by both Parties.
3.8.2 Modifications: Any amendment or modification to this Agreement must be in writing and signed (or expressly agreed electronically) by both Parties, except that Provider may update the Privacy Policy or GDPR/CCPA Addendum from time to time as needed to comply with law or improve practices; if such changes materially reduce Customer’s rights, we will notify Customer and such changes will not apply retroactively. In the event of a material change to an incorporated policy that Customer objects to, Customer may terminate the Services without penalty by providing written notice within 30 days of notice of the change, and receive a prorated refund of any unused prepaid fees.
3.8.3 Assignment: Neither Party may assign or transfer this Agreement to a third party, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the other Party’s prior written consent, except that either Party may assign this Agreement in its entirety (including all Order Forms) without consent to an affiliate or to a successor in interest in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Any attempt to assign in violation of this section is void. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.
3.8.4 Governing Law and Venue: This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Ohio, USA, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply. The Parties agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Franklin County, Ohio, and each Party consents to the personal jurisdiction and venue of those courts. Each Party waives any objections to jurisdiction or venue in those courts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property or Confidential Information.
3.8.5 Notices: All legal notices under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when delivered personally, sent by reputable overnight courier, or sent by certified mail (return receipt requested) to the addresses of the Parties set forth in the Order Form or above (for Provider’s address)[22]. Additionally, Provider may send general Service-related notices (such as planned downtime or updates) to Customer’s designated email contact. Email notice is sufficient for routine communications, but not for notices of indemnifiable claims, termination, or material breach, which must be sent via courier, mail, or personal delivery. Notices are deemed received upon delivery confirmation or, if by mail, on the 5th business day after mailing.
3.8.6 Relationship of Parties: The Parties are independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, or fiduciary relationship between the Parties. Neither Party has the authority to bind or act on behalf of the other in any manner.
3.8.7 No Third-Party Beneficiaries: There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. This Agreement is intended for the benefit of the Parties and their permitted successors and assigns only.
3.8.8 Force Majeure: Neither Party shall be liable for any delay or failure in performance (except payment obligations) due to events outside the defaulting Party’s reasonable control, such as natural disasters, acts of government, war, terrorism, labor disputes, internet or utility failures, or epidemics. The affected Party shall give prompt notice to the other and make reasonable efforts to mitigate effects. If such force majeure event continues for more than 60 days, either Party may terminate the affected Services with written notice.
3.8.9 Severability: If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be interpreted to fulfill its intended purpose to the maximum extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of the Agreement will continue in full force and effect.
3.8.10 Waiver: No waiver of any provision or breach of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by the waiving Party. A waiver of one breach shall not be deemed a waiver of any other breach. Failure or delay by either Party to enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
3.8.11 Headings and Construction: Section headings are for convenience only and shall not affect interpretation. Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa. “Including” means “including without limitation.” This Agreement shall not be construed in favor of or against either Party by reason of authorship.
3.8.12 Counterparts and Signatures: If this Agreement or any Order Form is executed in writing, it may be executed in counterparts (including PDF or electronic signature), which together will constitute one instrument. Electronic signatures or acceptances (such as through a “click-through” agreement) are valid and enforceable.
4. GDPR / CCPA Compliance Addendum
Effective Date: November 25, 2025
This GDPR/CCPA Compliance Addendum (“Addendum”) forms part of the Agreement between The RFP Queen, LLC (“Provider”) and Customer, and applies to the extent Provider processes Personal Data on behalf of Customer in the course of providing the Services. This Addendum is intended to ensure that both parties comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (along with any implementing regulations or successor laws, including CPRA) with respect to personal data/personal information processed under the Agreement. This Addendum uses the terms “Personal Data”, “processing”, “Controller”, “Processor” as defined in GDPR, and “Business”, “Service Provider”, “Consumer”, “Sell” as defined in CCPA, to the extent applicable.
4.1 Roles and Scope
4.1.1 Controller and Processor: As between the Parties, for Personal Data that Customer (as a Controller/“Business”) provides or makes available to Provider for processing in connection with the Services, Customer is the data Controller (or Business) and Provider is acting as a data Processor (or Service Provider). This means Provider will process such Personal Data only on Customer’s documented instructions and on Customer’s behalf. The subject matter, duration, nature, and purpose of processing, the types of Personal Data, and the categories of data subjects are those necessary to provide the Services as described in the Agreement (and may be further detailed in an Appendix if required by GDPR). Generally, this includes identification and contact data of Customer’s personnel or end-users (like names, emails) and any other personal information Customer uploads into the system (which could vary by use case, e.g., proposal document content that might include personal data).
4.1.2 Provider as Controller: The parties acknowledge that Provider may have separate legal grounds and obligations for certain data processing as a Controller. For instance, Provider is a Controller for its own business operations, such as handling Customer account information, billing details, or support communications (see Privacy Policy). These will be processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy and not as “processor” activities. This Addendum primarily governs data where Provider is processing on behalf of Customer.
4.1.3 CCPA Applicability: In cases where the CCPA is applicable (i.e., Customer is a Business subject to CCPA and Provider processes “Personal Information” on its behalf), Provider is a Service Provider to Customer. Provider certifies that it understands the restrictions and duties of a Service Provider under CCPA and will comply with them[23][24].
4.2 Obligations of Provider (Processor/Service Provider)
4.2.1 Processing on Instructions: Provider will process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Customer. The Agreement (including this Addendum) is Customer’s initial complete instruction to Provider. Additional instructions outside the scope of the Agreement (if any) must be agreed upon in writing by both Parties. Provider shall inform Customer if, in its opinion, an instruction violates applicable data protection law (but Provider will not be obligated to perform legal analysis).
4.2.2 Confidentiality: Provider will ensure that all personnel authorized to process Customer’s Personal Data are under a binding duty of confidentiality. Provider restricts access to Personal Data to employees or agents who need it to fulfill Provider’s obligations under the Agreement.
4.2.3 Security Measures: Provider shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, damage, or disclosure. These measures are described in the Agreement (see Privacy Policy’s Security section, and any security exhibit, if applicable) and include, for example, encryption in transit, access controls, and regular security assessments. Provider will regularly test and evaluate the effectiveness of these measures. Specific measures may include pseudonymization and encryption of Personal Data, ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems, ability to restore data in a timely manner, and processes for regularly testing security effectiveness (as appropriate, per GDPR Article 32).
4.2.4 Sub-Processors: Customer provides a general authorization for Provider to engage subcontractors that process Personal Data (“Sub-Processors”) as needed for delivering the Services (e.g., cloud hosting providers, email delivery services). Provider shall ensure any Sub-Processor is bound by data protection obligations no less protective than those in this Addendum, including maintaining security measures. Provider will remain liable for Sub-Processors’ performance of their obligations. Upon request, Provider will make available a list of current Sub-Processors. Provider will give Customer advance notice (for example, via email or portal) of any intended addition of a Sub-Processor that will process Customer Personal Data, and Customer may object on reasonable grounds relating to data protection. In such case, the parties will work in good faith to find a resolution; if none can be found, Customer may terminate the affected Services and receive a prorated refund.
4.2.5 Assistance with Data Subject Rights: Taking into account the nature of processing, Provider will assist Customer by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as possible, to fulfill Customer’s obligations to respond to data subject requests. This includes, if a data subject (or Consumer, under CCPA) contacts Provider to exercise rights (such as access, correction, deletion, objection, opt-out of sale, etc.), Provider will, where identifiable, promptly inform Customer and redirect the data subject to make the request directly to Customer. Provider shall not respond to such request unless authorized by Customer or required by law. Additionally, upon Customer’s request, Provider will provide reasonable information and tools (if available) for Customer to retrieve, correct, delete or restrict Personal Data to satisfy such requests. For example, Customer administrators can use in-product functionality to access or delete user data, if available, or otherwise can request assistance via support.
4.2.6 Assistance with Compliance: Provider will assist Customer in ensuring compliance with Customer’s obligations under GDPR Articles 32-36 (security, breach notification, DPIAs, prior consultation) and similar obligations under CCPA, taking into account the nature of processing and information available to Provider[25][26]. Specifically:
- Security and Audits: Provider will make available documentation or certifications describing its security measures and compliance with this Addendum. Provider will also allow and contribute to reasonable audits or inspections by Customer or its auditor (bound to confidentiality) for verifying compliance, provided such audits are limited to once per year and Customer provides reasonable advance notice. Audits must not unduly interfere with Provider’s operations. Alternatively, Provider may present recent third-party audit reports or certifications (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001) that address the effectiveness of its controls.
- Data Protection Impact Assessments: Provider shall provide reasonable cooperation and information needed for Customer to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments and, if necessary, consult with data protection authorities, regarding the processing of Personal Data under the Agreement.
- Breach Notification: In the event Provider becomes aware of a confirmed Personal Data Breach (as defined in GDPR) that affects Customer’s Personal Data, Provider will notify Customer without undue delay. Such notice will include information to assist Customer in meeting its breach notification obligations (to the extent available, e.g., the nature of the breach, likely consequences, measures taken or proposed to address it). Provider will promptly take steps to contain, investigate, and mitigate the breach, and will keep Customer informed of updates. Breach notifications will be sent to Customer’s designated security or IT contact (or primary business contact if none specified). Neither Party shall publicize a notice (e.g. press release) about a breach affecting the other’s data without prior consultation, except as required by law.
4.2.7 Deletion or Return of Data: Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, Provider will, at Customer’s choice, delete or return all Personal Data processed on Customer’s behalf, and delete any existing copies, unless storage is required by law[27][28]. Provider has described its data deletion practices in the Agreement (see Section 3.7.4). If Customer does not request return of data within the time available, Provider will proceed with deletion as described. Any retained data (if required by law or archived on backups) will remain protected by this Addendum.
4.2.8 No Sale of Personal Information: Under CCPA, Provider is prohibited from “selling” Customer’s Personal Information. Provider certifies that it shall not (1) sell any Personal Information processed on Customer’s behalf, (2) retain, use, or disclose such Personal Information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of providing the Services, including retaining, using, or disclosing the information for a commercial purpose other than providing the Services, or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA, and (3) retain, use, or disclose the information outside of the direct business relationship between Provider and Customer[23][24]. Provider also certifies it understands and will comply with these restrictions.
4.2.9 Data Localization and Transfers: If Customer or its data subjects are in the EEA, UK or other regions with data transfer restrictions, and Personal Data is transferred to Provider’s systems in the U.S. or other non-adequate country, the Parties agree such transfer is governed by the relevant Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) as prescribed by the EU or UK, which are hereby incorporated by reference. Provider will adhere to obligations of the “data importer” and Customer those of the “data exporter.” If needed, the Parties will complete any supplementary details or additional measures to ensure an adequate level of protection. Similarly, for other jurisdictions (e.g., Swiss FDPIC requirements, or others), the equivalent safeguards are considered in place. In summary, Provider agrees to provide an equivalent level of data protection as required by GDPR for transfers, through these contractual commitments.
4.3 Obligations of Customer (Controller/Business)
4.3.1 Lawful Data Provision: Customer represents and warrants that it has obtained all necessary consents or has another valid legal basis under GDPR (or appropriate notice under CCPA) for the Personal Data it instructs Provider to process. Customer shall not upload or otherwise provide Provider with any Personal Data that is not required for use of the Services. In the event Customer provides special categories of data (sensitive data) to Provider (which is generally not anticipated or recommended), Customer is responsible for ensuring it has the lawful basis to do so and shall inform Provider so that appropriate security measures can be applied.
4.3.2 Data Subject and Consumer Requests: Customer is responsible for handling any requests or complaints from data subjects or Consumers regarding Personal Data that Provider processes on Customer’s behalf. Should such a request or complaint be sent to Provider, Provider will, as stated above, forward it to Customer and await Customer’s instruction. Customer will comply with its obligations to respond to data subject requests under GDPR (Chapter III) and Consumer rights under CCPA. This includes providing necessary notices to individuals (e.g., privacy notices) and fulfilling deletion or opt-out requests. Provider’s assistance obligations are outlined above.
4.3.3 CCPA Compliance as a Business: If CCPA applies, Customer as a Business warrants that it has provided any required notices to Consumers and that it will honor Consumers’ exercise of rights. Customer will not instruct Provider to process Personal Information in a way that would cause a violation of CCPA by either party.
4.3.4 Indemnity: Customer shall indemnify and hold Provider harmless from any cost, charge, damages, expense or loss arising from Customer’s violation of this Addendum or data protection laws in the use of the Services, including any Customer instruction that infringes applicable laws. This indemnity is in addition to any other provided under the Agreement.
4.4 Audits and Certifications
As noted, Provider will allow for and contribute to audits as reasonably required. The scope of audits may be limited to information needed to demonstrate compliance with this Addendum. Customer must give at least 30 days’ notice of a requested audit, and both parties will agree on timing, scope, and security controls for the audit. Customer may also rely on Provider’s third-party audits and certifications as evidence of compliance in order to minimize the need for direct audits.
4.5 Miscellaneous (Data Protection)
4.5.1 Conflict: In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Addendum and any other provision in the Agreement or related documents, the terms of this Addendum shall prevail with regard to the processing of Personal Data. All other terms of the Agreement remain in full force.
4.5.2 Changes in Law: The Parties agree to negotiate in good faith any amendments to this Addendum necessary to comply with new or modified data protection laws or regulations.
4.5.3 Liability: The total liability of each Party and its affiliates arising out of or related to this Addendum (and the Standard Contractual Clauses, if applicable), whether in contract, tort or under any other theory of liability, is subject to the limitations and exclusions of liability set out in the Agreement, provided that nothing in this section limits either party’s liability to data subjects under the third-party beneficiary provisions of the Standard Contractual Clauses (if they apply).
By using or continuing to use the Services, each Party signifies its agreement to this GDPR/CCPA Addendum as part of the Agreement. This Addendum is effective as of the Effective Date of the Agreement or, for existing customers, from the date of latest update.
5. Clickwrap Consent Language & UX Implementation Standards
When presenting users with our Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy, The RFP Queen, LLC follows industry best practices for “clickwrap” agreements to ensure that user consent is informed and enforceable[29][30]. This section describes the consent language and user experience (UX) standards we implement on sign-up screens and other user consent points.
5.1 Recommended Consent Language: We use clear, concise language to obtain user agreement. For example, on our sign-up page, users will see a statement similar to:
By clicking "Sign Up", I agree to The RFP Queen’s Terms & Conditions and acknowledge the Privacy Policy.
Or, if a checkbox is used:
☐ I agree to the Terms & Conditions and have read the Privacy Policy.
The phrases “Terms & Conditions” and “Privacy Policy” are presented as prominent hyperlinks that users can click to read the full documents before consenting[31]. We avoid legal jargon in the consent prompt itself, making it simple and understandable – e.g., “I agree to…” clearly indicates that by proceeding, the user is accepting the terms[31]. This clarity fulfills the requirement that clickwrap use unambiguous language about what the user is agreeing to.
5.2 Active Affirmative Action: Our UX design requires users to take an explicit affirmative action to indicate consent[32]. This means:
If using a checkbox, it is unchecked by default (no pre-ticked boxes)[32]. The user must manually check it to proceed, ensuring an active choice. Pre-checked boxes are considered misleading and are not used[32].
The “Sign Up” or action button is disabled until the user checks the agreement box (or otherwise indicates consent), or we implement a double-click action (check + click) so that agreement cannot be inadvertent. In some cases, the button itself might say “Agree & Sign Up”, which further emphasizes the action of agreeing.
The design will not allow form submission unless the user has clearly agreed (for example, attempting to sign up without checking the box will prompt the user to review and agree to the terms first).
This approach ensures there's a record that the user affirmatively consented by clicking “I Agree” or equivalent[33], which courts have found critical to enforceability.
5.3 Conspicuous Presentation: We ensure that the consent request is highly visible and not buried in an obscure location[34]. Our standards include:
The text of the consent (e.g., “I agree to…”) is placed next to the signup button or checkbox in a legible font size (at least the same size as normal text, often slightly smaller than the heading but definitely readable).
The hyperlinks to terms are underlined and/or colored (typically blue) to indicate they are clickable[31]. We follow the convention that links are obvious.
Sufficient spacing and clear contrast are provided so that the consent language stands out – it’s usually the final step in the form, with no clutter around it. Users do not have to scroll excessively or navigate away without notice; the links either open in a new tab or a pop-up so the user can read them without losing the signup flow.
On mobile, the consent text is placed immediately above or below the Sign Up button (and the user may need to scroll through the terms if they choose to read them, but the acceptance checkbox is visible without needing to scroll further). We avoid putting the consent on a far separate screen unless absolutely necessary; typically it’s part of the sign-up screen for transparency.
The overall goal is that users can’t miss it: it’s “conspicuous — even obvious” what they are agreeing to[34]. By making the agreement step clear and upfront, we reduce the chance of a user later claiming they weren’t aware of the terms.
5.4 Opportunity to Review Terms: As noted, we link the full Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy right from the consent prompt. Users have the opportunity to click and read these documents before completing registration[35][30]. We do not hide the terms or require the user to go find them elsewhere. In fact, best practice (which we implement) may also include:
Using a scroll box or modal showing a summary or the entire text of terms that the user must scroll through, or at least confirming they had a chance to scroll. In some designs, we might require the user to scroll to the bottom of the terms text before the “Agree” button becomes enabled (ensuring they had an opportunity to see the content). This can further support that the user was presented with the agreement[36].
The interface clearly states something like “By creating an account, you indicate that you have read and agree to the Terms.” This sets the expectation that clicking Sign Up is not merely continuing, but actively giving consent.
We ensure adequate time and access for users to read the policies: no timeouts, and the user can open the links in a new window to read fully without losing form data.
5.5 Design for Enforcement: Our clickwrap implementation follows key design factors that courts have looked at in determining enforceability[37][38]:
The notice of agreement is near the action button (Sign Up) – on the same screen, not hidden below a page break.
The language clearly indicates that clicking the button means agreeing to terms (no vague phrasing).
The user is explicitly required to perform an action (checking a box) that is separate from other actions, specifically to agree. This creates a clear record of consent[39].
We keep records (logs) of the timestamp when a user agreed to the terms, and which version of the terms was in effect at that time. This way, if needed, we can demonstrate that on a certain date, a user consented to our terms (helpful in legal disputes). The terms pages themselves have a “Last updated” date, and we maintain archives of older versions. Our system logs user sign-up events and acceptance. Recordkeeping is part of our implementation standards to support legal enforceability[32] (“clear record that they...took a decisive action to agree”).
5.6 Updates and Re-consent: If we update our Terms & Conditions or Privacy Policy in a material way, our UX standards call for obtaining renewed consent from users when appropriate[40]. For example, after a significant terms update, the next time a user logs in, they might be prompted with a notice: “We have updated our Terms. Please review the changes. By continuing to use the service, you need to accept the updated Terms.” The user could be required to click “Accept” on a pop-up or check a box again. This approach ensures ongoing consent is informed when terms change, aligning with best practices (and certain jurisdictions’ requirements for clear notice of changes). We may also send out email notifications of policy updates, but in-app acknowledgement is a primary method. We do not silently change terms without notifying users who are already bound, especially if rights or obligations are materially affected[40].
5.7 Separate Consent for Separate Documents: If applicable laws or design considerations suggest, we might use separate checkboxes for separate consents[41]. For instance, one checkbox for “I agree to Terms & Conditions” and another for “I acknowledge the Privacy Policy” – especially if, say, the Privacy Policy acknowledgment is needed to comply with certain consent requirements (e.g., consent to collect personal data in some jurisdictions). However, generally agreeing to Terms implies acknowledgment of the Privacy Policy (since our Terms reference it). We avoid unnecessary checkboxes to keep UX simple, but ensure that all necessary consents are obtained. Where multiple consents are needed (e.g., one for terms, one for receiving marketing emails), we clearly distinguish them and avoid bundling them into one checkbox[42]. Users won’t be forced into agreeing to something optional in order to get something mandatory (no “tie-in” consent beyond what’s necessary for the service).
5.8 Visual Design Elements: We use visual cues (like a highlighted button or bold text) to indicate the action. The “Sign Up” button itself is usually a bright color and labeled in a way to indicate finality. The consent text is adjacent but not blended into a long wall of text – it’s typically a sentence on its own. The font of the terms link is typically standard but underlined. We ensure color contrast and readability for accessibility (meeting WCAG guidelines, e.g., sufficient color contrast ratio, focus indicators for keyboard navigation, etc.). Our forms are tested for screen readers, so the consent checkbox and label are properly announced, making the process accessible to users with disabilities[34][43].
5.9 Placement in Flow: We incorporate the consent at every appropriate point: definitely at initial account registration (web or mobile). Additionally, if we have other flows where a user might need to agree (like installing a mobile app, we’d include an in-app terms acceptance or ensure by using the app they have an enforceable clickwrap, possibly via app store flows or first-run). For any transaction that has separate terms (like an Enterprise customer agreeing to an Order), we’d similarly use an electronic signature or clickwrap acceptance of that contract.
In summary, The RFP Queen, LLC’s clickwrap implementation is designed to be clear, conspicuous, and user-friendly, while meeting legal standards for enforceability. By requiring an unambiguous affirmative action and providing easy access to our terms, we align our UX with best practices recommended by legal experts[34][32] and precedents (such as prominent disclosure and active consent, which have been upheld in court decisions). We regularly review our sign-up flow to ensure it remains compliant with evolving guidance and provides a smooth user experience that doesn’t sacrifice clarity of consent.
Sources: Our approach is informed by industry guidance and case law analyses, including resources from Docusign and TermsFeed on designing enforceable online agreements, which emphasize being conspicuous, using clear language, requiring explicit action, and keeping good records[34][32]. We also follow the practical recommendations from the International Association of Privacy Professionals and others for obtaining valid consent under regulations like GDPR (e.g., no pre-ticked boxes, separate consent for separate things, etc.). By adhering to these standards, we aim to protect both our users – by making sure they know what they’re agreeing to – and our company, by securing valid agreement to our terms.
