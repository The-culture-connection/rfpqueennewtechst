Search2
API Calls
The endpoint allows you to search for opportunities based on specific search parameters.

Authentication and Authorization
Authentication and authorization is not required for search2

Getting Started
Using your API test tool, make a POST call to the following URL: https://api.grants.gov/v1/api/search2, with the expected request in the body below, and you will receive a similar sample response.

Expected Request Body:	Sample Response
{ "rows": 10, "keyword": "20231011", "oppNum": "TEST-PTS-20231011-OPP1", "eligibilities": "", "agencies": "", "oppStatuses": "forecasted|posted", "aln": "", "fundingCategories": "" }	"errorcode": 0, "msg": "Webservice Succeeds", "token": "eyJ0eX……I1NiJ9. ", "data": { "searchParams": { "resultType": "json", "searchOnly": false, "oppNum": "", "aln": "", "sortBy": "", "oppStatuses": "forecasted|posted", "startRecordNum": 0, "eligibilities": "", "fundingInstruments": "", "fundingCategories": "", "agencies": "", "rows": 10, "keyword": "20231011", "keywordEncoded": true }, "hitCount": 1, "startRecord": 0, "oppHits": [ { "id": "219999", "number": "TEST-ABC-20231011-OPP1", "title": "Test-ABC-20231011-Opp1 title!", "agencyCode": "HHS", "agencyName": "Health & Human Services", "openDate": "10/11/2023", "closeDate": "", "oppStatus": "posted", "docType": "synopsis", "alnist": [ "93.223" ] } ], "oppStatusOptions": [ { "label": "posted", "value": "posted", "count": 1 }, { "label": "closed", "value": "closed", "count": 0 }, { "label": "archived", "value": "archived", "count": 0 }, { "label": "forecasted", "value": "forecasted", "count": 0 } ], "dateRangeOptions": [], "suggestion": "20201111", "eligibilities": [ { "label": "County governments", "value": "01", "count": 1 } ], "fundingCategories": [ { "label": "Arts", "value": "AR", "count": 1 } ], "fundingInstruments": [ { "label": "Grant", "value": "G", "count": 1 } ], "agencies": [], "accessKey": "", "errorMsgs": [] } }
Here's a visualization of the high-level response:

ID	Number	Title	Agency Code	Agency	Open Date	Close Date	Opportunity Status	Document Type	ALN List
289999	TEST-PTS-20231011-OPP1	Test-PTS-20231011-Opp1 title!	HHS	HHS	10/11/2023		posted	synopsis	93.223
Curl Samples
URL: Search by Multiple Criteria
The below cURL is a search by fundingCategories, agencies, oppStatuses, and ALN:

curl -k -v -i --location 'https://api.grants.gov/v1/api/search2' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"fundingCategories": "HL", "": "HHS-NIH11", "oppStatuses": "forecasted"}'

URL: Search by Multiple Criteria with ALN
The below cURL is a search by fundingCategories, agencies, and oppStatuses:

curl -k -v -i --location 'https://api.grants.gov/v1/api/search2' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"fundingCategories": "HL", "agencies": "HHS", "oppStatuses": "forecasted", "aln": "93.866"}'

URL: Search by Combined Statuses and Keywords
You might want to send combined statuses as an array or as separate key-value pairs based on your backend handling. Below is an example that treats combined statuses as an array:

curl -k -v -i --location 'https://api.grants.gov/v1/api/search2' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"oppStatuses": ["closed| archived"], "keywords": "points"}'



Simpler Grants.gov

API Gateway Developer Guide
Overview
The Simpler Grants API Gateway provides developers with programmatic access to search federal grant opportunities through a RESTful API. This guide walks you through generating an API key via our web interface and integrating with your applications to search for funding opportunities.

The API is currently in early development. Features are under active development and subject to change. To see the latest changes please take a look at our OpenAPI doc. 

Getting Started
Are you looking for more guidance? Check out our full API tutorial to get started creating applications that leverage the Simpler.Grants.gov API. 

Prerequisites
A user account on the Simpler Grants platform

Basic understanding of REST APIs and HTTP requests

Access to make HTTP requests from your application

Step 1: Generate Your API Key
Log into the Platform

Navigate to the Simpler Grants website

Sign in with your Login.gov credentials

Access the API Dashboard

Go to the developer page under the community dropdown or via this link

Click "Manage API Keys" after reading through the developer page.

Create a New API Key

Click "Create API Key" 

Provide a descriptive name for your key (e.g., "My Grant Search App")

Click "Create API Key" to create the key

Step 2: API Authentication
All API requests must include your API key in the X-API-Key header:


Copy
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
API Endpoints
Base URL
Production: https://api.simpler.grants.gov

Development: Contact support for development endpoints

Core Endpoints
Search opportunities
Extracts
Common Issues
Invalid API Key

Ensure key is included in X-API-Key header

Verify key is active and not expired

Check for typos in the key

Request Format Errors

Ensure Content-Type: application/json header

Validate JSON syntax

Check required fields (pagination is required)

Parameter Validation

page_size must be between 1 and 100

Date formats must be YYYY-MM-DD

Enum values must match exactly (case-sensitive)

Best Practices
Rate Limiting
The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage

If you receive 429 responses, implement exponential backoff

Consider caching results to reduce API calls

If you are searching all opportunities then use the extracts endpoint

Efficient Searching
Use specific filters to reduce result sets

Implement pagination for large result sets

Consider using CSV format for bulk data downloads

Security
Never expose API keys in client-side code

Store keys securely using environment variables

Rotate keys periodically

Use HTTPS for all requests

Error Handling
Always check HTTP status codes

Implement retry logic with backoff for transient errors

Log errors for debugging but don't expose sensitive information

Example Use Cases
Grant Discovery Dashboard
Deadline Monitoring System
Funding Analytics
Build a dashboard that shows relevant opportunities based on user preferences:


Copy
def get_relevant_grants(user_interests, applicant_type):
    filters = {
        "opportunity_status": {"one_of": ["posted", "forecasted"]},
        "applicant_type": {"one_of": [applicant_type]}
    }
    
    # Search for each interest area
    all_opportunities = []
    for interest in user_interests:
        payload = {
            "query": interest,
            "filters": filters,
            "pagination": {"page_offset": 1, "page_size": 10}
        }
        # Make API call and collect results
        opportunities = search_opportunities(payload)
        all_opportunities.extend(opportunities)
    
    return deduplicate_opportunities(all_opportunities)
