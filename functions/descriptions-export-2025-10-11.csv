SAM,https-sam-gov-workspace-contract-opp-85c7f85dc8a74fc081c3667b068ca26e-view,J065--Notice of Intent to Sole Source Canon CT Service,"In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b), this Notice of Intent is to inform all parties the Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 19 located at 6162 South Willow Drive Suite 300, Greenwood Village, CO 80111 intends to award a sole source procurement for the following requirement to the small business manufacturer, CANON MEDICAL SYSTEMS USA, INC., located at 2441 MICHELLE DR, TUSTIN, CA 92780: Item # Description/Part Number* Qty 0001 CANON Prime CT scanner, SN: 8LA2222196 1 Canon Medical Systems will perform annual service maintenance to existing equipment under manufacturer warranty. This activity proposes to issue sole source delivery orders against an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract SPE2D1-17-D-0022 awarded to Canon Medical Systems for the purchase of annual service maintenance to existing equipment located at individual VHA medical facilities. RESPONSE CONSIDERATIONS This Notice of Intent to Sole Source is not a Request for Quotes (RFQ). The VA is not accepting proposals; rather, the VA is publicly publishing its intent to sole source. Responses that seek to offer replacement of the Canon contract will not change the VA s intention. The VA is not seeking to replace the current Canon contract SPE2D1-17-D-0022. Respondents who make claims of capability, without supporting evidence, will not be considered. It is not enough to simply claim capability. Any response must counter all five points of supporting rationale. SUPPORTING RATIONALE This Sole Source Service Maintenance Agreement (SMA) orders covers (but not limited to) the following high tech medical equipment (HTME): Computed Tomography (CT) scanners, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems, radiographic systems (X-Ray), nuclear medicine, ultrasounds, computed radiography, magnetoencephalography, Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-CT, PET-MR scanners, cyclotrons, angiography, cardiac catheterization, and mammography systems, etc. Previously, a determination had been made that this requirement meets the exception at FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B). Only one source can provide the required services. All awardees were given fair opportunity to be considered for the original order. Service maintenance agreement is required to cover the lifecycle of the equipment purchase. Because the requirements are already purchased and have not exhausted their lifecycle, purchasing the service maintenance in support of the equipment after post warranty ensures the equipment is compliant with VHA technology standards and policies. Canon Medical Systems Radiology and Imaging Systems are proprietary; therefore, any follow-on maintenance should be performed directly by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and not outsourced to a third party to maintain the integrity of the equipment and to avoid servicers not familiar with the products causing damage to the equipment. If damage is caused by a third party in the course of repairs, then the Government could be held liable for additional costs associated with repairs performed by the OEM after damage has occurred. As such, the work can only be completed by one source, which is the OEM of the equipment. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement no later than 1:00pm Mountain Standard Time, Wednesday, October 15, 2025. Information received in response to this notice must clearly demonstrate the capability of meeting the Government s need as stated above. Include any relevant information (specifications, cut sheets, brochures, capability statement, etc.) confirming the ability to supply the products and/or any services outlined in this notice. Responses to this notice are to be sent to jason.lawrence3@va.gov. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government is not responsible for any potential costs incurred from interested parties desiring to respond to this notice.",sam,,2025-10-15T13:00:00-06:00

Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or program manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at 385-591-1672.
